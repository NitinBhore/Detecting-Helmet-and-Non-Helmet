# Detecting-Helmet-and-Non-Helmet
Detecting Helmet and Non-Helmet-Wearing Individuals in Images

# Background:
Head injuries due to the lack of helmet usage can be life-threatening. To promote safety and reduce accidents, it is essential to detect whether individuals in images are wearing helmets or not. The aim of this assignment is to develop a computer vision system to automate the detection of helmet and non-helmet wearing individuals from images.

# Problem Statement:
Design and implement a machine learning or deep learning solution to detect whether individuals in images are wearing helmets or not.

# Key Requirements:

Dataset Collection: Collect or obtain a comprehensive dataset of images containing individuals with varying backgrounds and demographics. The dataset should be well-labeled to indicate whether each individual is wearing a helmet or not.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare and preprocess the dataset, which may include tasks such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

Model Development: Create a machine learning or deep learning model that can effectively classify images into two classes: "Helmet Wearing" and "Non-Helmet Wearing."

Model Training: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset. Employ appropriate techniques for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization.

Accuracy and Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Ensure that the model can provide reliable and consistent results.

Real-time Detection: Implement the model for real-time detection of helmet and non-helmet wearing individuals from images. The system should be capable of processing images in near real-time and making predictions.

User Interface (Optional): Develop a user-friendly interface (e.g., a web application or mobile app) for users to upload images and receive instant feedback on whether individuals in the images are wearing helmets or not.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the model for inference speed and efficiency, ensuring it can be used in real-world applications without significant computational overhead.

# Deliverables:

Trained model for helmet detection.
Documentation detailing the model's architecture, training process, and usage guidelines.
